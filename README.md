# COVID vs India Data Visualization

A Python-based data analysis project to visualize and analyze COVID-19 statistics in India.

## Overview

This project, originally developed as a 12th-grade final project during the peak of the pandemic, analyzes COVID-19 data in India, including confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery rates. It provides visual representations and insights about the pandemic's impact across different states and union territories of India. The timing of the project's development allowed for real-time analysis of one of the most significant health crises of our time.

## Features

- Analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases
- Death rate visualization
- Recovery rate analysis
- State-wise comparison
- Time series analysis of COVID-19 spread

## Data Information
ðŸ“… The dataset used in this visualization covers COVID-19 statistics in India up to 2020. Please note that this historical data does not include updates beyond 2020.
